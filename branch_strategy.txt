    1. Create Dev Branch:

# Create a new branch named 'dev' based on the main branch
git checkout -b dev
# Push the dev branch to the remote repository
git push origin dev

    2. Create Feature Branch:

# Create a new branch for a feature (e.g., feature/user-authentication)
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication dev
# Make changes, commit them, and push the feature branch to the remote repository
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user authentication"
git push origin feature/user-authentication

    3. Merge Feature into Dev Branch:

# Switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev
# Merge the feature branch into the dev branch
git merge feature/user-authentication
# Push the changes to the remote dev branch
git push origin dev

    4. Delete Feature Branch after Merging:

# Delete the feature branch locally
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
# Delete the feature branch on the remote repository
git push origin --delete feature/user-authentication

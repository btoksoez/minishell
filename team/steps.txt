STRUCTURE:

- minishell loop that keep prompting and calling different functions once prompt is given
	- parsing
		- error checking (unclosed quotes etc.)
		- lexer: put all input into a linked list, pass to parser
		- parser: identify redirections, builtins, and other text correctly and put them in lists and delete from lexer list
		- pass back the struct that holds all lists of different arguments
	- expanding
		- replace $ with envps
	- execution
		- builtins need to be executed in parents process because they are changing properties of the process itself
		- special case heredoc?
		- open forks for number of commands, make child run them -> order?
		- pipes between childs and parent
		- handling redirections

TODO:
- understand readline functions
- understand signals
- understand directory functions
- understand why we need terminal functions
- git branch strategy

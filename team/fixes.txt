TESTS TO FIX:

8. cat < infile | ls > out (infile no permissions, out with permissions)
should be permission denied: infile, exit code 0

12. readline: when writing over line, need to handle?

13. freeing after signals in heredoc

14. echo -n -n segfault

9. < Makefile cat | cat -e | cat > out
valgrind fds still open

12. make protections in libft

11. Give the correct exit codes to children

12. Add Signals to children

7. exit 3 | ls

15. (STILL HAD LEAKS) + wrong exit code
cat < dhuhskjdsjks << ola
correct: executes heredoc then error msg
> sdjk
> sdjk
> ola
bash: dhuhskjdsjks: No such file or directory
output:  bash: dhuhskjdsjks: No such file or directory

15. The first one should work but the second not
andre-da@c1r18s8:~/42-Github/minishell$ cat <<1 <<2 <<3
andre-da@c1r18s8:~/42-Github/minishell$ cat <<1<<2<<3
-> if delimiter is a number, then you need space afterwards
